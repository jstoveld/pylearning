In the control room was silence like fabric strained to the verge of
tearing. Softly through the weave of it came the murmur of the engines,
fretful, unhappy, the whimper of something sick.

The whimper echoed Thettumir's feelings. He gestured suddenly at the
telescopic space scanner, the six snake-like digits of his hand stiff
with dismay.

"But that is all? There are no other planets in this region?"

"None." Vandumonn shook for added emphasis the erect spiny crest which
ran from the top of his head down the middle of his back. "I have made
absolutely certain of that. This is the only planet. The next nearest
sun is ten light-years away. But listen to the engines, Commander. I am
an astronomer, not an engineer, yet I know the engines will not take
us that far. Even if they could, it would be a gamble as to whether or
not that next nearest sun had planets."

Thettumir gazed once more at the magnified image in the scanner.
It showed a great red sun, already well on its way toward cooling,
and far off to the right, a silvery speck which was the only planet
circling the dying giant. He reached for the dial which increased the
magnification of the scanner and twirled it until the disc of the
planet filled the entire screen.

The battered flagship had approached closer, but, as before, Thettumir
was able to make out no details. The planet was covered with
clouds--strange dense gray clouds. He knew the clouds indicated an
atmosphere--perhaps even a breathable one--but his reluctance to accept
the planet as a temporary repair base was due to the fact that the
clouds would make landing extremely difficult. The Urgollian fleet was
already badly damaged, and additional injuries would only complicate
matters further.
